            <h2>What is the focus?</h2>
            <p>The Focus is a small, wearable device that enhances the user's perception and provides access to information about the world around them. It allows Aloy to scan her environment, identify threats, and interact with ancient technology.</p>
            <p>The Focus is a small, triangular augmented reality device worn on the temple. It originates from the Old World and provides Aloy with enhanced perception. It’s like a sixth sense, a bridge to the past and a guide for the future.</p>

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>The Focus works by scanning the environment and providing real-time information about objects, creatures, and points of interest. It can highlight weak points in machines, reveal hidden paths, and even allow communication with other Focus users.</p>
            <p>It’s a tool that connects Aloy to the remnants of the Old World, allowing her to uncover secrets and navigate the dangers of her world. It can also track the movement of other humans or creatures</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">The Focus is a Class-C wearable augmented reality device designed for advanced personal data interfacing, field diagnostics, and AI-integrated environmental analysis. When affixed to the user's temple, the device syncs with cortical activity, enabling real-time data overlays, terrain mapping, machine interfacing, and encrypted communication with nearby systems.

Focus units are approved for use by authorized engineers, security personnel, and project overseers operating in zero-network or blackout zones. Field logs indicate successful performance in hazardous environments, including ferro-corpse recovery sites and automated terraforming zones.

Units must be returned for degaussing and wipe after mission completion. Unauthorized users will trigger biometric lockdown protocols.</p>
